# SkillSync-AI-Powered-Job-Skill-Matcher
🧠 **Problem It Solves**:

*Job seekers struggle to understand which skills they lack for their target roles. Recruiters want faster candidate screening. SkillSync bridges this gap using AI and automation.*

🚀 **Project Overview**:

  SkillSync allows users to:

  -Upload a resume (PDF).

  -Enter a target job role (e.g., “Data Analyst”).

  -The backend parses the resume, compares it with the target job role using an AI model or job description parser, and outputs:

  -Skill match percentage
  
  -Missing skills
  
  -Suggested learning paths (like Coursera/YouTube links)
  
  -Optionally, recruiters can upload a JD and instantly screen multiple resumes.
